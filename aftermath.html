        <h1>Aftermath of the Revolution</h1>
        <p>
            The end of the Revolution ushered in two decades of "Goulash 
            Communism" under János Kádár, a softer dictatorship that 
            sought stability through modest economic reform.

    <h1>The Crushing of the Uprising</h1>
    <p>
        The early successes of the Revolution would not last. Whilst the heroism and bravery of the 
        revolutionaries had taken the Soviet Union, and the rest of the world, by surprise, the 
        Red Army quickly recovered.

        News bulletins at the time described the build up of Soviet troops:

        Operation Whirlwind brought a decisive end to the Hungarin Revolution. Tanks entered Budapest 
        from every direction, meeting fierce resistance from civilians and militias who had little 
        more than rifles and Molotov cocktails. 
        <br>
        <br>
        By 11 November, organised resistance had been wiped out. Thousands of Hungarians were killed 
        or wounded, and much of Budapest lay in ruins. Around 200,000 people fled the country, in 
        what became one of Europe's largest post-war refugee crises. 
    </p>
    <h1>Arrests and Repression</h1>
    <p>
        In the weeks following the invasion, the new Soviet-backed regime led by János Kádár began restoring 
        control. Promises of amnesty quickly gave way to a campaign of mass arrests, trials, and executions. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Over 20,000 people were imprisoned and thousands more were sent to labour camps. Roughly 230 
        revolutionaries were executed, including soldiers, students, and workers who had led the fighting. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Among them was Imre Nagy, who had sought asylum in the Yugoslav Embassy but was lured out under 
        false guarantees of safety. He was secretly tried and executed in June 1958, along with several of 
        his associates. Their bodies were buried in unmarked graves.
    </p>
    <h1>The Kádár Government</h1>
    <p>
        Despite his collaboration with Moscow, Kádár gradually distanced himself from the brutality of the 
        early years. By the early 1960s, executions stopped, prisoners were released, and Hungary entered a 
        period known as "Goulash Communism".
        <br>
        <br>
        This was a softer form of dictatorship that sought to balance loyalty to the Soviet Union with limited 
        domestic reform. Citizens were allowed small freedoms. Private farms, limited travel to the West, 
        and better access to good.
        <br>
        <br>
        While economic conditions improved, political freedom remained restricted. The events of 1956 were 
        erased from public discussion. Schools, newspapers, and films portrayed the revolution as a 
        "counter-revolution" led by facists and imperialists. For more than three decades, the truth remained 
        officially suppressed.
    </p>
    <h1>Legacy and Revival</h1>
    <p>
        As Soviet control began to weaken in the 1980s, calls for reform once again spread across Eastern 
        Europe. The Revolution of 1956 was once again seen as a national uprising, not treason. 
        <br>
        <br>
        On 16 June 1989, the remains of Imre Nagy and his comrades were reburied with full honours in Hero's 
        Square. Over 200,000 people attended, many carrying the same red-white-green flags with the communist 
        emblem cut out in memory of the Revolution. 
        <br>
        <br>
        That summer, the Iron Curtain began to fall, and Hungary once again stood at the forefront of change 
        in Europe. The Revolution's message, and it's demands for freedom, truth, and independence, had finally 
        prevailed. 
    </p>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
        Though the 1956 uprising ended in tragedy, it remains one of the most important symbols of resistance in 
        20th Century Europe. It revealed the fragilty of Soviet control and inspired later movements for freedom 
        in Czechoslovakia and Poland.
