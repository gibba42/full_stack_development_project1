        <p>
            On 23 October, students from the Technial University organised 
            a peaceful march through Budapest. They read out their Sixteen Points, 
            which called for free elections, withdrawal of Soviet troops, and press freedom.

    <h1>The evening and the outbreak of violence</h1>
    <p>
        <b>At around 19:00, another large group marched to the 
        Hungarian Radio Headquarters to have the 16 points broadcast.</b> ÁVH (State Security Police) guards
        refused to let them in. A small delegation of students was allowed to enter to negotiate, but were
        instead arrested and beatn. When word of this reached the gathered crowd, anger erupted. Protesters
        shouted demands for their release and tried to force their way into the building. 
        <br>
        <br>
        As the crowd tried to force their way into the building, the ÁVH fired warning shots over their heads.
        Despite this, the protestors held their ground and as tensions rose, the lights in the surrounding 
        streets were switched off. In the confusion, the ÁVH began firing directly into the crowd. Several 
        protestors were killed or wounded, marking the first casualties of the revolution. 
    </p>
    <h1>The Spark</h1>
    <p>
        <b>As the day went on, more people joined.</b> University students, factory workers, and ordinary citizens. 
        By the afternoon, tens of thousands were marching through the streets of Budapest, waving the Hungarian tricolour 
        with the communist emblem cut out, chanting "Russians go home!" and "We want Imre Nagy!"
        <br>
        <br>
        They gathered at the Statue of General Józef Bem, a hero of both Polish and Hungarian freedom movements, 
        where the atmosphere was jubilant and full of hope. Later, crowds tore down the statue of Stalin, a towering symbol 
        of oppression, leaving only his boots behind on the plinth. This would go on to become one of the Revolution's most 
        powerful images.

    <h1>Violence at the Radio Headquarters</h1>
    <p>
        <b>That evening, a large group of protestors gathered outside the Hungarian Radio Headquarters.</b> The ÁVH (State Security Police) refused to let them in. When a small 
        delegation of students entered to negotiate, they were arrested and beaten.
        <br>
        <br>
        Word of their capture spread quickly, and the situation escalated. As the crowd tried to push their way into the building, the ÁVH opened 
        fire, killing and wounding several protestors. These were the first casualties of the revolution, and the moment when peaceful protest 
        turned into armed revolt. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Across the city, soldiers began handing over weapons to the crowd, and groups of freedom fighters began forming spontaneous militias. 
    </p>
    <h1>Imre Nagy and the New Government</h1>
    <p>
        <b>By 24 October, the situation was spiralling out of control.</b> Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest that night under orders to restore order. 
        The following morning, Imre Nagy, a reformist communist and former Prime Minister of Hungary, was reinstated in an attempt to calm the 
        population.
        <br>
        <br>
        Initially, Nagy called for peace and reform within the socialist framework, but as the fighting spread, he moved toward a position of 
        open independence.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the days that followed, workers' councils and revolutionary committees took control of factories, universities, and discricts of the 
        city. The ÁVH disintegrated, and Soviet troops temporarily withdrew. For a few short days, it seemed that Hungary had won its freedom. 
    </p>
    <h1>Withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact</h1>
    <p>
        <b>On 30 October, Nagy announced the formation of a new government.</b> Censorship was abolished, 
        and political prisoners were released. Then, on 1 November, Nagy took the boldest step of all. He declared Hungary's neutrality and announced 
        its withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact, apealing to the United Nations for protection. For a brief, euphoric moment, Hungarians believed they had 
        reclaimed their country's independence. 
    </p>
    <h1>The Soviet Return</h1>
    <p>
        <b>In the early hours of 4 November, Soviet forces launched Operation Whirlwind.</b> This was a full-scale invasion with over 2,500 tanks and tens of thousands 
        of troops. They surrounded Budapest and bombarded key resistance points such as Corvin köz, Széna tér, and Kilián Barracks.
        <br>
        <br>
        Fighting raged street by street for nearly a week. Despite their determination, the revolutionaries were outgunned and outnumbered. By 
        11 November, the uprising was crushed. 
    </p>

    <h1>The Cost</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Thousands were killed and many more wounded.</b> Around 200,000 Hungarians fled across the western border into Austria to escape Soviet retribution. 
        Imre Nagy sought asylum in the Yugoslav Embassy but was later arrested and eventually executed in 1958.

        The Revolution of 1956 was a military defeat, but it left an enduring legacy. It became a symbol of courage and defiance, proving that even under 
        Soviet rule, the desire for freedom could not be extinguished.
