        <h1>Causes of the Revolution</h1>
        <p>
            After World War II, Soviet forces remained in Hungary, and the Communist 
            Party, backed by Moscow, took control. The 
            years that followed were marked by repression, forced 
            collectivisation, and secret-police terror under Mátyás 
            Rákosi.

        <b>From 1949 onward, Mátyás Rákosi, the self-proclaimed "Stalin's best pupil", 
        led a hard Stalinist dictatorship.</b> Political opponents were imprisoned, executed, 
        or exiled, and the ÁVH (State Security Police) became a symbol of fear and brutality. 
        Ordinary Hungarians were encouraged to denounce their neighbours, creating an atmosphere 
        of deep mistrust.

        <b>The Communist regime eliminated opposition parties.</b> They abolished freedom of speech, and 
        controlled all aspects of life. Show trials were staged to remove perceived enemies, 
        and intellectuals, priests, and even loyal party members could be accused of treason.
        <br>
        <br>
        The cult of personality around Stalin and Rákosi dominated public life. His image appeared 
        in schools, factories, and on the walls of every public building. Criticism of the government 
        or of the Soviet Union was treated as a crime.

    <h2>Economic Hardship</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Economic reform damaged rather than revived Hungary.</b> Rákosi's policy of forced industrialisation attempted to transform Hungary from an agricultural 
        society into a model socialist state. Heavy industry was prioritised over consumer goods, 
        leading to shortages, poor living standards, and widespread poverty. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Farmers were forced into collective farms, surrendering their land and livestock to the state. 
        The result was a sharp decline in agricultural productivity and growing resentment in rural areas. 
        <br>
        <br>
        By the early 1950s, wages had falled, food was scarce, and inflation was rampant. Despite these 
        hardships, propaganda painted an image of prosperity and success, deepening public cynicism.

        <b>The death of Stalin in 1953 brought cautious optimism across Eastern Europe.</b> In Hungary, Imre 
        Nagy became Prime Minister and introduced his "New Course" policy. It relaxed censorship, improving 
        consumer goods production, and releasing political prisoners. 
        <br>
        <br>
        For the first time in years, Hungarians began to hope for genuine change. But in 1955, Nagy was dismissed, 
        and Rákosi returned to power, reversing reforms and reinstating repression. This abrupt shift reignited 
        popular anger. 
        <br>
        <br>
        By 1956, Hungary was simmering with frustration. Tired of Soviet control, economic suffering, and political 
        fear. The success of reformers in Poland that year inspired Hungarian students, workers, and 
        intellectuals to act. 
        <br>
        <br>
        On 23 October 1956, these tensions finally boiled over into open defiance.
