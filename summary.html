        <h1>The Hungarian Revolution of 1956</h1>
        <p>In October 1956, the people of Hungary rose against Soviet domination 
            demanding independence and democracy. It was a brief, yet key defining 
            moment in European history and the Cold War. Learn more about the causes, 
            key moments, and the lasting effects of the revolution.

    <h1>Causes</h1>
    <p>
        <b>After World War II, Soviet forces occupied Hungary.</b> The Hungarian Communist Party, 
        backed by Moscow, took control under Mátyás Rákosi. His regime was marked by political 
        repression, show trials, and secret police terror. Thousands were imprisoned or 
        executed, and the economy suffered under forced industrialisation and collectivised 
        farming.
        <br>
        <br>
        By the mid-1950s, frustration had reached a breaking point. Inspired by reform movements 
        in Poland, Hungarian students, workers, and writers began calling for change. They demanded 
        free elections, freedom of speech, and the withdrawal of Soviet troops.

    <p>
        <b>On 23 October 1956, students in Budapest organised a peaceful march to present their Sixteen 
        Points.</b> A list of national and democratic demands. The crowd grew into tens of thousands, 
        gathering around symbols of national pride such as the statue of General Józef Bem and the 
        Hungarian Radio Headquaters.
        <br>
        <br>
        Demonstrators attempted to broadcast their demands. ÁVH (State Security Police) guards 
        opened fire, killing several protestors. The violence ignited a nationwide revolt. 
        For several days, freedom fighters seized control of Budapest, pulling down Soviet emblems and 
        destroying the statue of Stalin. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Prime Minister Imre Nagy was reinstated. He announced plans for political reform, press freedom, 
        and withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact. These moves directly challenged Soviet authority.

    <h1>Aftermath</h1>
    <p>
        <b>In the early hours of 4 November 1956, Soviet tanks re-entered Budapest.</b> They crushed the uprising after 
        fierce fighting. Thousands of Hungarians were killed, and around 200,000 fled abroad as refugees. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Nagy was arrested, tried in secret, and executed in 1958. His replacement, János Kádár, established 
        a new government that pledged loyalty to Mosow. In the following decades, Hungary entered a period 
        known as "Goulash Communism", a softer form of dictatorship that offered limited economic reform and a modest 
        improvement in living standards, but no political freedom.
        <br>
        <br>
        Though defeated, the Revolution left a deep mark on Hungarian identity and became a powerful 
        symbol of resistance against Soviet domination across Eastern Europe.
