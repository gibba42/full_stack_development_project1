    <h1>Why the Revolution Matters</h1>
    <p>In October 1956, Hungarian students and workers rose up 
        against Soviet control, demanding freedom, democracy, and 
        the withdrawal of Soviet troops. What began as a peaceful 
        protest soon escalated into a nationwide uprising that shook 
        the Communist bloc and inspired movements across Europe. 
        Though the revolution was crushed within weeks, its legacy 
        lived on as a symbol of resistance and national pride.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Hungarian Revolution was one of the first major challenges 
        to Soviet control in Eastern Europe. Though the uprising was crushed 
        by Soviet tanks, its spirit lived on. It inspired later movements 
        across the Eastern Bloc and contributed to the eventuall fall of 
        Communism in 1989.
