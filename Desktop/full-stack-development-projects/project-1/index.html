    <h1>Learn about the Hungarian revolution of 1956</h1>
    <p>In October 1956, Hungarian students and workers rose up 
        against Soviet control, demanding freedom, democracy, and 
        the withdrawal of Soviet troops. What began as a peaceful 
        protest soon escalated into a nationwide uprising that shook 
        the Communist bloc and inspired movements across Europe. 
        Though the revolution was crushed within weeks, its legacy 
        lived on as a symbol of resistance and national pride.</p>
