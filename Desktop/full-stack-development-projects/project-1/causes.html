    <h1>Causes of the Revolution</h1>
    <p>After World War II, Soviet forces remained in Hungary, and 
        the Communist Party, backed by Moscow, took control. The 
        years that followed were marked by repression, forced 
        collectivisation, and secret-police terror under Mátyás 
        Rákosi.
