    <h1>The Revolution</h1>
    <p>On 23rd October, students from the Technical University 
        organised a peaceful march through Budapest. They read out 
        their Sixteen Points, which called for free elections, 
        withdrawal of Soviet troops, and press freedom.

        <h2>The Sixteen Points of 23 October 1956</h2>
        <p>These demands, written and read by University students 
            at the statue of General Józef Bem, ignited the 
            Hungarian Revolution.

            <ol>
                <li>We demand the immediate evacuation of all Soviet troops, 
                    in conformity with the provisions of the Peace Treaty.
                </li>
                <li>We demand the election by secret ballot of all Party members 
                    from top to bottomw, and of new officers for the lower, middle, 
                    and upper echelons of the Hungarian Workers Party. These officers 
                    shall convene a Party Congress as early as possible in order to 
                    elect a Central Committee.
                </li>
                <li>A new Government must be constituted under the direction of 
                    Imre Nagy. All criminal leaders of the Stalin-Rákosi era must 
                    be immediately dismissed.
                </li>
                <li>We deman public enquiry into the criminal activities of Mihály 
                    Farkas and his accomplices. Mátyás Rákosi, who is the person 
                    most responsible for crimes of the recent past as well as for our 
                    country's ruin, must be returned to Hungary for trial before a 
                    people's tribunal.
                </li>
                <li>We demand general elections by universal, secret ballot are held 
                    throughout the country to elect a new National Assembly, with all 
                    political parties participating. We demand that the right of workers 
                    to strike be recognised.
                </li>
                <li>We demand revision and re-adjustment of Hungarian-Soviet and 
                    Hungarian-Yugoslav relations in the fields of politics, economics 
                    and cultural affairs, on a basis of complete political and economic 
                    equality, and of non-interference in the internal affairs of one by the other.
                </li>
                <li>We demand the complete reorganisation of Hungary's economic 
                    life under the direction of specialists. The entire economic 
                    system, based on a system of planning, must be re-examined in 
                    the light of conditions in Hungary and in the vital interest 
                    of the Hungarian people.
                </li>
                <li>Our foreign trade agreements and the exact total of reparations 
                    that can never be paid must be made public. We demand to be 
                    precisely informed of the uranium deposits in our country, on 
                    their explotation and on the concessions to the Russians in this 
                    area. We demand that Hungary have the right to sell her uranium 
                    freely at world market prices to obtain hard currency. 
                </li>
                <li>We demand complete revision of the norms operating in industry 
                    and an immediate and radical adjustment of salaries in accordance 
                    with the just requirements of workers and intellecuals. We demand 
                    a minimum living wage for workers.
                </li>
                <li>We demand that the system of distribution be organised on a new 
                    basis and that agricultural products be utilised in rational 
                    manner. We demand equality of treatment for individual farms.
                </li>
                <li>We demand reviews by independent tribunals of all political and 
                    economic trials as well as the release and rehabilitation of the 
                    innocent. We demand the immediate repatriation of prisoners of

                </li>
                <li>We demand complete recognition of freedom of opinion and of 
                    expression, of freedom of the press and of radio, as well as the 
                    creation of a daily newspaper for the MEFESZ Organisation 
                    (Hungarian Federation of university and College Students' Associations).
                </li>
                <li>We demand that the statue of Stalin, symbol of Stalinist 
                    tyranny and political oppression, be removed as quickly as possible 
                    and be replaced by a monument in memory of the martyred freedom 
                    fighters of 1848-49.

                <li>We demand the replacement of emblems foreign to the Hungarian 
                    people by the old Hungarian arms of Kossuth. We demand new uniforms 
                    for the Army which conform to our national traditions. We demand that 
                    March 15th be declared a national holiday and that October 6th be a 
                    day of national mourning on which schools will be closed.
                </li>
                <li>The students of the Technological University of Budapest declare 
                    unanimously their solidarity with the workers and students of Warsaw 
                    and Poland in their movement towards national independence.

                    decided to convene at Budapest, on Saturday October 27th, a Youth Parliament
