    <h2>The evening and the outbreak of violence</h2>
    <p>
        At around 19:00, another large group made up of mostly students and workers marched to the 
        Hungarian Radio Headquarters to have the 16 points broadcast. ÁVH (State Security Police) guards
        refused to let them in. A small delegation of students was allowed to enter to negotiate, but were
        instead arrested and beatn. When word of this reached the gathered crowd, anger erupted. Protesters
        shouted demands for their release and tried to force their way into the building. 
        <br>
        <br>
        As the crowd tried to force their way into the building, the ÁVH fired warning shots over their heads.
        Despite this, the protestors held their ground and as tensions rose, the lights in the surrounding 
        streets were switched off. In the confusion, the ÁVH began firing directly into the crowd. Several 
        protestors were killed or wounded, marking the first casualties of the revolution.
